## (a)

We can assume that the model we are fitting here is a logistic
regression model since the outcomes are binary: yes, no, and donâ€™t know.
We can also say that since the model (BP,DP) relies on the the
association between B and D conditional on P, given that the answer to
the question about an African-American president (P) is Yes.

``` r
model0 <- glm(Count ~ Busing*President + Home*President, 
              data = survey_data, family = "poisson")
summary(model0)

## (b)

We can use the Likelihood Ratio Test to measure goodness of fit.

``` r
# Here we anova as a likelihood ratio test statistic for goodness of fit.
LRT_test <- anova(model0, test = "LRT")
LRT_test
```

The model demonstrates we fit in part (a) demonstrates a satisfactory
level of fit when examining the associations between attitudes toward
busing and presidential preferences, as well as presidential preferences
and home invitations.

While the p-value for the b:p relationship suggests a less robust level
of significance, both relationships are characterized by low deviances
and residual deviances, indicating that the modelâ€™s predictions are
relatively close to the observed data.

Above we have the different confidence intervals for the counts,
including the 95% confidence intervals for the interaction terms. We can
see that all the estimates in the summary table fall in the confidence
intervals, we are 95% confident the parameters are true.

``` r
#If we want to compute the likelihood ratio test we also need a saturated version of the model fit
sat_model <- glm(Count ~ Busing + President, data = survey_data, family = "poisson")
LRT <- logLik(model0, sat_model)
```

    ## Warning in logLik.glm(model0, sat_model): extra arguments discarded

We want to include the maximum number of parameters, hence, we need a
saturated model. We can see that model0 is better at predicting the
counts than the saturated model based on the lRT ratio.

## (d)

We can evaluate various models and review their summary tables to
determine if they are suitable.

``` r
# Here we don't have interaction terms between the variables
model1 <- glm(Count ~ Busing + Home + President, 
              data = survey_data, family = "poisson")
# Here we have a interaction between B and P, H and B
model2 <- glm(Count ~ Busing*President + Home*Busing, 
              data = survey_data, family = "poisson")
# Here we have a interaction between B and H, H and P
model3 <- glm(Count ~ Busing*Home + Home*President, 
              data = survey_data, family = "poisson")
# Here we have a interaction between B and P, H and P
model4 <- glm(Count ~ Busing*President + Home*President, 
              data = survey_data, family = "poisson")
```
